Generate cross version extensions for FHIR

This repository holds documentation (/doc), sample code (/src) and intial extension defintions (/result) of experiments done on the generation of FHIR cross-version extensions (see section [2.1.7.0.7 Extensions for converting between versions](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#extensions) of the FHIR specification).

**Disclaimer:** This work is intended to be used to facilitate the discussions in HL7 and is not intended to be the definite source for these extensions.
