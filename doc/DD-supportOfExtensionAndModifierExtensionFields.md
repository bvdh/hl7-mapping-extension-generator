# Support of extension and modifierExtension fields

Do the cross-version extensions need to support fields of type `extension` or `modifierExtension`?

As this is allowed anyway on all resources, this field does not seam to add much value and will be ignored.

**DECISION:** Do not create extension and modifierExtension cross-version extensions.
